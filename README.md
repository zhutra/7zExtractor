# 7zExtractor

```
```
  <archive_file>                        Required. Path to file
  --to <destination_folder>             Required. If it doesn't exist, it will be created
  --re "new_name"                       Optional. Rename the extracted folder with
  --from "..." or ...                   Optional. Match a folder to extract from
